## Storybook

[Storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook) allows one to develop/style components in isolation.
Each component directory contains a respective `story.js` file. `./src/components/stories.js` imports all stories for use in Storybook.

### Usage
* `npm run storybook`
* Visit http://localhost:6006
* Develop/Style components as normal. Changes will be hot reloaded.
